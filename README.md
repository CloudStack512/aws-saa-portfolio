This repository showcases four professional-level AWS projects that demonstrate my skills as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect (SAA). Each project includes:

Architecture diagrams showing service relationships and data flow

AWS console screenshots proving hands-on implementation

Step-by-step instructions and scripts used to deploy infrastructure

Documentation of testing and outcomes

Projects cover the full spectrum of SAA topics, including EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda, API Gateway, VPC, RDS, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch, and SNS.

All resources were tested and then deleted to manage costs. Screenshots and diagrams serve as proof of practical experience.
